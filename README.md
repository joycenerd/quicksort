#  Quicksort program

## Introduction ##

This is a small C++ program doing quicksort. I didn't use STL like swap and partition, I do this all by myself. Choosing a pivot, partition the elements into less than or equal to pivot and greater than pivot two pile, and then swap pivot into the right place, and then do the same thing all over again in each pile until all the element is sorted to the right place.

### Step 1 ##


Enter the type of element you want to sort

### Step 2 ##

Enter your test case using specific format

### Step 3 ##
 
 You will get the sequence being sorted
